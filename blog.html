      <p>UrbanLinker.com is a website that serves as a search engine for careers. The

website from first glance is very appealing to the eye. It is a bright gradient of purple and

blue with an interactive image as the cover. At the top of the page is the websites logo

and tabs that direct you to what the site does. As far as page organization it is

straightforward and easy to understand when you first enter the site. The main image on

the page is a man and a woman. The woman with a pair of binoculars with the hyperlink

placed in front of her called “Recruiter?”. The man photographed as if he is searching,

and he has the hyperactive link titled “candidate”. This allows for users to immediately

understand that one side is to create a profile if you are looking for job, and the other if

you are a company searching for employees.

Beneath the main imagery are paragraphs and images placed on a slide show with

headings such as; dream jobs of the day, salary guides, and all types of other career useful

tools. As far as the color scheme of the page, it is vibrant yet simple. With the use of

purple and blue with a background that’s black it creates a sleek and edgy site.

The site alone is an extremely useful tool. The heading in the top right corner of

the page contains links that say “I am a” and “job offers”. These are great things to have

in the top of the page because when all else fails if a user does not know what to do they

go to the top of the page, and this allows for user to either create a profile or look for a

career. The two images below that serve, as the same useful link is a unique way to

choose what sort of profile you’d like. The idea that it’s interactive allows for the user to

be involved with the site. Despite the sites sleek and edgy feel half of the side is in

French so that throws off the consistency of the website. It is also really straight to the

point, which can serve as a good and bad thing. It is good because it’s easy to use

however it is bad because it makes the site get boring and old after a few minutes. The

site could also improve by adding a menu bar so that users know what the page has to

offer.</p>
