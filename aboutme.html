  <div class="cell">My name is Aryn Morris and fashion is my life. I have always been into fashion design and making my own clothes, however college has allowed for me to broaden my design knowledge. Since majoring in design i have opened the world of Graphic design, coding design, structural fashion design and painting. All aspects of design are key when going into the creative world, and my creativity has grown to new lengths and height.</div>

  <div class="cell">Blogging and the documentation of my interest in fashion has become my main source of outlet. I feel invigorated after I’ve completed a photoshoot or personally took photos for my blog. It is so exciting to know that all the content is original and authentic. my blog is a source for fashion, which is why this portfolio serves as important because it is not only what i do in fashion, but what i do as a designer, which is extensive and impressing. Check out what I’ve worked up thus far! </div>
